# Contributing

Keep changes focused and explain the problem, resulting behavior, and validation
in the pull request. Start with the [architecture documentation](docs/architecture/README.md)
and [architectural decision records](docs/architecture/decisions/README.md).
AI coding agents also follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Shaping work

Shape substantial features before implementation: describe the problem, rough
solution, risks, and excluded work. Small fixes and documentation corrections do
not need a pitch. Bound each pitch by a useful playable experiment; add an appetite
or deadline only if your project wants one.

Save pitches as `docs/pitches/<topic>/pitch--<slug>.md` using the
[pitch template](docs/pitches/README.md#template), and add them to the pitch index.
The [starter platformer pitch](docs/pitches/starter-platformer/pitch--starter-platformer.md)
is a worked example of the sections: Problem, Solution, Security, Rabbit Holes, and
No-Gos. Explain relevant security concerns or why none apply. Keep Excalidraw
breadboards and rough sketches beside the pitch and link them from Solution when
they help explain interactions or layout.

Pitches describe intent. Architecture documentation describes implemented behavior
and conventions; ADRs preserve significant choices and tradeoffs. Update the
relevant documents with implementation changes. Do not treat the broader
[game idea](docs/idea.md) as a commitment to implement every direction it lists.

## Branches and commits

Use short-lived branches and reviewed pull requests. The default branch is `main`;
use the intended integration branch as the PR base. Prefer `feature/<slug>` or
`bugfix/<slug>`, including an issue ID when useful. Link the relevant issue or
pitch and use a draft PR for early feedback.

Use Conventional Commits: `<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>`. Common types
are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore`. Use a concise
description and separate optional bodies and footers with blank lines. Mark
breaking changes with `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer and explain migration
requirements. Squash commit messages follow the same convention.

```text
feat(player): add a wall jump
fix(run): keep collected coins after falling out
docs: describe the level map format
```

## Setup and validation

Follow the [README requirements](README.md#requirements) for Rust and native
dependencies. `Cargo.toml` declares the minimum Rust version and Bevy features;
`Cargo.lock` pins dependency resolution; [.mise/config.toml](.mise/config.toml)
pins the toolchain. On x86_64 Linux, [.cargo/config.toml](.cargo/config.toml)
selects Clang and LLD; on NixOS, run the checks inside `nix-shell`
([shell.nix](shell.nix)). Keep dependency or toolchain changes deliberate, change the
Rust version in `Cargo.toml` and `.mise/config.toml` together, and explain such
changes in the PR.

Run from the repository root for code changes:

```sh
mise run check
```

which runs:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --locked
cargo test --locked
```

There are no CI workflows yet. Tests include unit tests beside each module and
headless simulation tests in `src/tests.rs`, which step the real plugins at the
fixed timestep. Prefer focused tests of game rules and ECS systems that can run
without a window. Include regression coverage for meaningful bugs; avoid tests that
merely duplicate implementation details. Run a subset with `mise run test <name>`.

For rendering, input, or gameplay changes, also run:

```sh
mise run run
```

Check the affected behavior manually in the starter level:

- A/D and the arrow keys run; releasing stops quickly. The player faces its
  direction of travel, and motion looks smooth.
- Holding jump clears the wall before the last gap; tapping gives a short hop.
  There are no midair jumps.
- The player cannot pass through walls, ceilings, or the floating platform.
- Coins disappear on touch and the HUD count rises.
- Falling into a gap returns to the start with coins and time kept.
- Touching the flag stops the clock and shows the finish cue; only Restart works
  until then. Restart restores all coins, the start position, and the clock.
- A controller runs with the stick or D-pad, jumps with South, and restarts with
  Select. Escape quits.

Record what was checked; if no graphical environment is available, report that
limitation.

For documentation-only changes, verify relative links and claims against source,
then run `git diff --check`; a full Rust build is unnecessary. Report checks
actually run, failures, and skipped coverage in the PR. Avoid unrelated formatting
and changes to generated `target/` contents.

## Architecture decisions

Use the [ADR workflow and index](docs/architecture/decisions/README.md) for lasting
choices such as physics integration, input handling, persisted formats, or
simulation scheduling. Copy the [template](docs/architecture/decisions/_adr-template.md),
explain the alternatives and consequences, and identify how reviewers can detect
drift. Routine implementation details do not need an ADR.
